			    The inspiration of the style was taken from the <b>Sumerian cuneiform</b> which is known to be the earliest writing system. Its origins can be traced back to about 3,200 BC and it developed from the pictographs and other symbols used to represent trade goods and livestock on clay tablets.</p> 

          <img src="img/sum/claytablet.jpg " alt="Cuniform Tablet" align="center" width="50%">

          <p id="dropcap" class="mb-3" align="justify">
          The word cuneiform derives from Latin ‘cuneus’, meaning <b>‘wedge-shaped’</b>. It refers to the shape made each time while engraving cuneiform symbols with a reed stylus into the clay. In order to convey the idea of Sumerian tokens <b>engraved</b> on the clay texture, we made use of CSS property <b>text-shadow</b>: as well as <b>white</b> contrasting colour to make letters more <b>integral and real</b>.</p> 

          <p><b>Fonts</b></p> 

          <p id="dropcap" class="mb-3" align="justify">

        While manipulating fonts we opted for <b>Kakoulookiam</b> font for headings since the font includes every known <b>glyph</b> for the ancient inscription.
        Assuming that only a few people can read and understand sumerian script we used the <b>:hover selector</b> to display heading with a readable font when users mouse over them.</p>

        <p id="dropcap" class="mb-3" align="justify">

For the &lt;p&GT; articles content part we operated a smoother <b>Cuneiform</b> font which tries to emulate ancient script with familiar characters, making them <b>pointed and edgy</b>.</p> 

<p id="dropcap" class="mb-3" align="justify">

<b>Peskyphoenicians</b> font was used for image captions to create the feeling of extra ancient mystery and make users get a better idea of sumerian style text representation at the visual level. For instance, some letters  have the <b>inclination</b> or <b>token symbols</b> similar to that used by the sumerians.</p> 

<img src="img/sum/cuneiformtablet.jpg " alt="Cuniform Tablet">

<p id="dropcap" class="mb-3" align="justify">
By using <b>column CSS properties</b> we specified the style of the rule between columns to create that “lined” texture inherent to clay tablets.</p>

                          <p id="dropcap" class="mb-3" align="justify">
The history of <b>typewriter typography</b> begins with the nineteenth century. The first typewriter to be commercially successful was invented in <b>1878</b>. Despite the evolution of typewriters cover more than a century, there are some typographical <b>long lasting conventions</b> that mostly derived from the limitations of the typewriter keyboard itself: the use of <b>monospace fonts</b> (both serif and sans-serif), the <b>paragraph indentation</b>, the practice of <b>underlining text</b> in place of using italics, or the use of <b>all capitals</b> to provide <b>emphasis</b> or to identify <b>titles</b>.

<img src="img/type/type1.gif" alt="Typewriter official document" width="35%" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-top:10px;"> Monospaced typefaces were born from the limitations of mechanical typewriters. When the typist pressed a key, the carriage moved the paper the same distance each time, so it was easier to return to a previous printing point to make corrections and do tabulation work.

For what concerns the font family, we opted for <b>Special Elite</b>, since it was expressly created to mimic the <b>Smith Corona Special Elite Type</b> No NR6 and <a href="http://machinesoflovinggrace.com/rems.htm" target="_blank">Remington Noiseless</a> typewriter models. 

<img src="img/type/type2.gif" alt="Typewriter usual document" width="35%" align="left" style="padding-right:10px; padding-top:10px;">

Furthermore, typewriters were not originally justification-capable machines, mainly because the <b>space between words</b> was <b>fixed</b>. Since the first device which allowed the automatic justification of text was patented most likely in 1920, we decided to keep this layout 

<img src="img/type/type3.jpg" alt="Olivetti" width="35%" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-top:10px;">

feature, that fits better the style of the typewriter of the late nineteenth century. In our stylesheet, the spacing between words has been set at 6px.

Some <i>examples</i> of this typographic design can be found in <a href="https://archividigitaliolivetti.archiviostoricolivetti.it/en/" target="_blank">Olivetti Archive</a>, while the main <i>historical information</i> were taken from <a href="https://typographica.org/" target="_blank">Typographica </a>, a review of typefaces and type books, with occasional commentary on fonts and typographic design founded in 2002.

The Bauhaus was a German art school founded in <b>1919</b> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gropius" target="_blank">Walter Gropius</a> in Weimar. The organization combined teachings of <b>architecture, art and design</b> through a rationalistic approach, with a specific attention to new technologies. <b>Fine arts and crafts</b> were the bases of the movement, which in fact was able to deal with all the disciplines, from sculpture to design, from ceramics to graphics.

<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
The style of Bauhaus is commonly characterized as a combination of <b>decoration and functional essentiality</b>. Thus, typical Bauhaus designs – evident in painting, architecture, or interior design – feature <b>little ornamentation</b> and a focus on <b>balanced forms and abstract shapes</b>. In this aspect, the influence of artists as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky" target="_blank">Wassily Kandinsky</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Klee" target="_blank">Paul Klee</a>, both teachers of the school (the first one from 1919 to 1923 and the second from 1921 to 1931).

</p>

<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
Our choices for the typographic design of our <b>Bauhaus Style</b> are based exactly on this essentiality, starting from the background proposed for the page itself. The decorativism and dynamism of this style are due to some expedients such as the <b>rotation of some titles</b>, the insertion of <b>lines and geometric shapes</b> inside the texts, and the use of <b>simple colors</b> – like <b>black and red</b> – but wisely alternated. 
</p>

Regarding the choice of the <b>font family</b>, we opted for <b>Bauhaus 93</b> whose design is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Bayer" target="_blank">Herbert Bayer</a>'s 1925 experimental Universal typeface. It is a decorative font with <b>simple geometric forms and even strokes</b> that give the font a clean and distinctive look. 

The background image of the article is a recent reproduction of the typical Bauhaus graphics, while the <b>specific color</b> most used in the typography of this style was chosen as the background of the article, which is the <b>#ead2b0</b> code obtained thanks to the tool <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp" target="_blank">Color Zilla</a>, by Google Chrome.

<h4>WHAT & WHEN</H4>
</p>

<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
For the <b>second half of the XX Century</b> we chose <b>Pop art</b> movement, in particular <b>Roy Lichtenstein typography</b>. 
Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid-to late-1950s. In particular, the term "pop art" was officially introduced 

<img src="img/popart/poplogo.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" style="padding-top:10px; padding-left:10px">
in <b>December 1962</b>; the occasion was a "<i>Symposium on Pop Art</i>" 

 organized by the Museum of Modern Art.
The movement presented a <b>challenge to traditions of fine art</b> by including imagery from <b>popular</b> and <b>mass culture</b>, such as <b>advertising</b>, <b>comic books</b> and mundane cultural objects. Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of <i>Campbell's Soup Cans</i>, by Andy Warhol. One of its aims is to use images of popular (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of <b>irony</b>.
It is also associated with the artists' use of <b>mechanical means of reproduction</b> or rendering techniques.

<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
<H4>WHO & WHY</H4>
</p>
<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
We decided to choose Roy Lichtenstein (1923-1997) as the artist of excellence of pop art "typography" for many reasons. It work is exciting, vibrant, and ironic as the '60s were. Its use of parody produces a hard-edged, precise composition that documents while also parodying in a soft manner the <b>old-fashioned comic strip</b> that he chose as subject matter. As the other American artists, 

<img src="img/popart/popart1.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" style="padding-top:10px; padding-left:10px">

bombarded every day with the diversity of mass-produced imagery, Lichtenstein's work features <b>thick outlines</b>, <b>bold colors</b> and <b>Ben-Day dots</b> ("<i>My style just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's</i>.").
</p>
<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
Lichtenstein used oil and Magna paint in his best known works, such as '<i>M-Maybe</i>' (1965), '<i>Ohhh...Alright...</i>' (1964). and '<i>Drowning Girl</i>' (1963), the tree artworks that had been chosen as background to the articles. 

<img src="img/popart/ohh.jpg" alt="" width="30%" align="left" style="padding-top:10px; padding-right:10px">

Each of them was appropriated from stories in DC Comics' <i>Secret Hearts</i>, like '<i>Ohhh...Alright...</i>', taken from #83.
</p>
<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
Lichtenstein had a desire that <b>his paintings look</b> as <b>mechanical</b> as possible although he was a painter. He selected teen and action comics as subjects also since they were <b>illustrated by teams</b> that produced source material that was devoid of "personal elements of style". In this sense we also considered Lichtenstein's "<b>typography</b>": because his painting seem mechanical and <b>impersonal</b>, potentially <b>reproducible</b>. Lichtenstein's comics-based women, in fact, "look hard, crisp, brittle, and uniformly modish in appearance, as if they all came out of the same pot of makeup."

<H4>WHERE</H4>

<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
</ul>
<li align="justify" class="mb-3">The <b>font</b> used is a free version of the famous '<i>Roy Liechtenstein font</i>' ('<a href="https://www.wfonts.com/font/dupuyballoon" target="_blank"><i>Dupuy Balloon</i></a>');
<li align="justify" class="mb-3">The <b>background of the article</b> has been made with salmon on white Ben-day dots as background, to recreate the most used colors of the skins of Liechtenstein's ladies;
<li align="justify" class="mb-3">The <b>head titles</b> (&lt;h1&GT; and &lt;h2&GT;) feature a change of font ('<a href="https://www.dafont.com/badaboom-bb.font" target="_blank">Badaboom</a></i>') and two different kinds of <b>comic ballons</b>: a 'shouted' one for &lt;h1 and a 'spoken' one for &lt;h2&GT;;
<li align="justify" class="mb-3">All the <b>images</b> have a filter saturation of 900% to reach as much as possible the <b>pure primary color</b> (red, blue, yellow);
<li align="justify" class="mb-3">The <b>audio</b> included in the style is "<a href="" target="_blank"><i>Doo Wah Diddy Diddy</i></a>" by the rock band <i>Manfred Mann</i>. It was chosen because, written in <b>1964</b>, it conveys all the sparkling and happy atmoshpere of those years, and because the subject of the music is a natural, carefree and joyful love ("<i>There she was just walking down the street / Before I knew it she was walking next to me / holding are hands just as natural as can be / We walked on to my door / Then we kissed a little more / Now we're together / We're so happy and that's how we're gonna stay</i>");
<li align="justify" class="mb-3">Several <b>additions</b> had been made along the article by means of css pseudo-selectors (':after', ':before'): three exclamation points ("!!!") in the title (&lt;h1&GT;), "SBAM!" in the subtitle (&lt;h2&GT;), "$@*#&" in the &lt;h3&GT; and words "INCREDIBLE" and "CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?!!!" to the inline elements, as displayed below.

All these choices had been made to remain as faithful as possible to the original Lichtenstein's style and with the <b>serialization</b> typical of the typography, in particular here the one of <b>comics strips</b>, with text in balloons, captions, "vulgar language" ($@*#&) and exaggeration (pointed out by question marks).

        The decrease in the cost of computing technology in the 1980s led to an arcade explosion and video games popped up everywhere and became a dominant cultural force, having marked the 80’s as the golden age of arcade games.</p>

        <p class="mb-3" align="justify">

        The whole design is the epitome of arcade game screen from the 80s, games were simple and had little complexity.</p>

        <b>Fonts</b></p>

        <p class="mb-3" align="justify">

        To convey the spirit of the golden age of arcade games we made use of the most authentic fonts of the 80s. </p>

        <p class="mb-3" align="justify">
        <b>SF Atarian System</b> font was inspired by <b>Atari</b>, a video games company originally founded by Ted Dabney and Nolan Bushnell. It is widely considered as the pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles. SF Atarian System is a close match to those used by Atari on its logo and their 2600 and 5200 cartridges and boxes.</p>

        <p class="mb-3" align="justify">
        <b>Death Star</b> font is the reminiscent of <b>Star Wars</b> logo from the 80s, the one with the redesigned “W", other letters widen and letter-spacing increased. Apart from being a vivid allegory to a famous movie/game, Death Star font uses uppercases which were extensively used in headings in the printed press during the decade.
        </p> 
        <p class="mb-3" align="justify">
        <b>Emulogic</b> is a pixel font that makes a reference to pixel fonts developed from the invention of the computer and were based on the on-screen display format of pixels. Those fonts that are based on an array of pixels, are often called Bitmap fonts and are often designed only for a specific point size.</p> 

        <p class="mb-3" align="justify">
        The photo frames in the articles that consists of 2 blue lines as well as dots represent PacMan pattern that is arguably the most famous and influential game to emerge from the ’80s. Furthermore, the dot-matrix pattern is reminiscent of the characters displayed on old text-based terminal screens.</p>

        Design manipulates a few basic colors: red, blue, white, black, yellow and orange. The chosen color palette recalls that color scheme used in video games. Furthermore, red, blue, green and orange were popular colors in the printed press in the 80s since the period was characterized by extensive use of vivid, experimental headings to create a totally captivating look.</p>
